**Spring\_security: Spring Security and JWT Learning Examples**

This repository contains code samples and explanations demonstrating various aspects of Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure API access in Spring Boot applications.

**Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:**

      - Java (JDK 11 or later recommended)
      - Maven or Gradle (build tool)
      - A code editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Spring_security.git
    ```

3.  **Import Project (Optional):**
    Import the project into your preferred IDE for easier navigation and code completion.

4.  **Run the Examples:**
    Each example directory likely has specific instructions within its README or code comments. In general, you might follow these steps:

      - Open a terminal in the project directory.
      - Build the project:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install (Maven)
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        gradle build (Gradle)
        ```
      - Run the Spring Boot application (refer to specific example instructions).

**Examples (Modify as needed)**

This repository is structured to include various learning examples. Replace the example names with your actual ones:

  - `basic-auth`: Simple username/password authentication with Spring Security.
  - `user-roles`: User roles and authorization with Spring Security.
  - `jwt-auth`: JWT authentication with Spring Security and JWT libraries (e.g., Spring Security JWT, JJWT).
  - `custom-filters`: Creating custom Spring Security filters for specific authentication or authorization needs.
  - `exception-handling`: Handling security exceptions (e.g., `AccessDeniedException`, `AuthenticationException`).
  - `refresh-tokens` (optional): Implementing refresh tokens for long-lived JWT tokens.

**Disclaimer**

This repository is intended for educational purposes. Consider security best practices and secure your applications thoroughly before deploying them in production environments.

**Customizations**

  - Replace `basic-auth`, `user-roles`, etc., with your actual example directories.
  - Update prerequisites and build instructions as needed for your setup.
  - Provide specific instructions in each example's README or code comments.
  - Consider adding diagrams or screenshots if they enhance understanding.
  - Include references to any specific JWT libraries you're using.
  - Modify the license section if you are using a different license.

By following these guidelines and tailoring the content to your specific project, you can create a comprehensive and informative README.md file to guide your learning of Spring Security and JWT authentication.
